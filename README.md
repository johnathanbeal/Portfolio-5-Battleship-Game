# Summary
Early in 2020 I decided that I needed to become a Software Development Engineer in Test (and perhaps someday an SDET with Machine Learning Skills).  I re-enrolled in Andy Sterkowitz's Software Development Mastermind Program and the first project he assigned me was a battleship game.   I enjoyed this assignment because it forced me to improve several SDET skills including C#, problem solving, refactoring and unit testing.  I did this assignment from scratch, without using a game template or Googling 'How to write a battleship game'.  I enjoed this challenge, which took me less than 1 month to complete.
